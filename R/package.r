#' Add-ons and enhancements for ggplot2
#'
#' This package contains some miscellaneous add-ons for ggplot2,
#' including new geoms, new positioning algorithms, and new
#' faceting.
#'
#' As suggested by the name, these are \emph{hacks}: they may not
#' be well thought-out, and are certainly not cleanly implemented.
