# ggplothacks

`ggplothacks` is a R package providing miscellaneous add-ons and
enhancements for the [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) statistical
graphics and visualization package.

As suggested by the name, these are *hacks*, and may not be carefully
thought out or implemented.  They may depend in fragile ways on
implementation details of `ggplot2`.
